## Context

Time to start the project! What prior art will we leverage to create the thing!

## Decision

First thoughts are Typescript, React. The app doesn't need a service / persistance layer, and can exist as a purely frontend application. These tools will help us to jump to value as quickly as possible given existing knowledge and tooling. For a bundler, we'll start with vite, because we've used and enjoyed it.

## Consequences

The design will be secondary in this case, because I don't have any design framework in mind and this leaves the visual and usability aspects as open questions.
