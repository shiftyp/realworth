Date: 2022-08-23

## Status

Status: Accepted on 2022-08-23  
Amends [0002-documentation-generation-with-mkdocs.md](0002-documentation-generation-with-mkdocs.md) on 2022-08-23

## Context

The "ReadTheDocs" theme was a little too "documentation like", not blog like

## Decision

We're switching to the material theme for MKDocs

## Consequences

Not my favorite, but at least it looks a little more like a blog
